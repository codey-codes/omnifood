## Description: ##
There are options for monthly subscriptions out there for services like video streaming, music streaming, grocery delivery, ad-free services etc. This company (also not real) provides a monthly subscription to food delivery. Lunch or dinner (or both) will be delivered to your doorstep everyday and you don't even have to order. How easy is that? This is my first HTML/CSS project.
